The focus is on investigating the iron and zinc content in wheat seeds sourced from diverse regions in India, categorized based on cultivation methods using K-means clustering. Both iron and zinc are crucial micronutrients, contributing significantly to various physiological functions within the human body. The objective is to discern nutritional patterns influenced by geographical and cultivation variations.
